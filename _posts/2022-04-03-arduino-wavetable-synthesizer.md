This project is a wavetable synthesizer I built as part of my master of engineeering degree at McMaster University

**When:** 2014

**Why:** As part of the masters degree program we got to select a project that posed an engineering challenge and 

**How:** The implementation of this synthesizer came in two parts. One was a C++ program made for playing sound based on pre-generated wavetables and the second was a C# program that generated
