When starting my job search I found I was often limited by the amount of content that could be conveyed in the typical formats (resumes, cover letters, bios, etc) and I wanted to create a place where recruiters/future peers could go to get a broader understanding of my background, interests and experience.
Being a web developer for most of my professional experience I thought the best way to showcase this information would be a webpage, where users could seek out the info the want without being overwhelmed by too much information.
